## Disclaimer

I do not own the original mod. This is based on "Dustman," a mod originally uploaded to Nexus Mods around 2018–2019. The original author has since been banned from Nexus Mods. I have fixed and ported the mod to My Winter Car, but I take no credit for the original work. If the original mod author contacts me and wants it removed, I will take this down.
